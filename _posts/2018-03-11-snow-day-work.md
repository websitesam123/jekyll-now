Snow day work

Maze: i found maze a nice game to start with as the script was easy but still fun. The hardest level was obviously level 10 as it is more of a maze and you only have 9 blocks to complete it.

Turtle: I like how it made us do the way with loops so we can't just say forward right ect. In this game i actually found nine the hardest as 10 is just make your own.

Pond: This was easily the hardest game that was set as i couldnt do it without going through the tutor. After that it was a tanks like game but just with code. I also like that on this one there are ais .
